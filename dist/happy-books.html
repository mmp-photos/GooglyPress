During her career she taught students at nearly every level including kindergarten, primary grades, middle school, college and grad school. She taught at the renowned Key Learning Community that became nationally and internationally known for a curriculum based on Howard Gardner’s theory of “multiple intelligences” and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s theory of “flow” among others.</p><p>Her teaching experience informs the types of books published by Googly Press. With an emphasis on the joy of learning and using our brains in a myriad of positive, productive ways, she looks forward to publishing “happy little books” for both children and adults.</p></div></main></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col"><footer></footer></div></div></div></body></html>
